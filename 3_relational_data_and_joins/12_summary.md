# Summary
- Relational databases are called relational because they persist data in a set of relations, or tables
- A Relationship is a connection between entity instances, or rows of data, usually resulting from a relationship between what those rows of data represent
- Three levels of schema are conceptual, logical, and physical
- Three typs of relationships are 1:1, 1:M, M:M
- A conceptual schema is a high-level design focused on identifying entities and their relationships
- A physical schema is a low-level database-specific design focused on the implementation
- Cardinality is the number of objects on each side of the relationship
- Modality indicates if the relationship is required or not
- Referential integrity is a data property that requires every value in one column of a table to appear ni a column of (usually) another table
